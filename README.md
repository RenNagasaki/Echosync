# Echosync
Ever wanted to play together with your friend, significant other or free company mates but got annoyed trying to sync the dialogues?
Fret no further! Here comes Echosync!!!
It connect's you and your companions together. Just join a channel and start storying!

## Dislaimer: 
* This plugin connects either to my self hosted server (wss://sync.echotools.cloud) or a server hosted by someone else. I only log the ip addresses connecting to my server, no character/server data.
* This plugin is still in it's early stages of development, feel free to report any issues here or on my [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-blue)](https://discord.gg/5gesjDfDBr) (preferred)

## Commands
* `/es` - Opens the configuration window.

## Features
* Syncs all DIALOGUES in the game, meaning: If you start talking to, for example, Glazrael in the Lower Decks and your synced friend does so as well, the dialogue only advances after both of you tried to advance it(Sending ready to server).
* In the event of you starting a dialogue solo and no one else connects you can do the dialogues as if you were alone.

## Planned Features
* Authentication system for better security.
* Option to setup a channel with a password so no one can join the channel you're using unless they know the password.

## Setup/Install
* Per default the plugin installs ready to go. (Connecting to my server)
* Open the config window either via the dalamud window or by using the command /es.
* Enter the channelname and click connect.
* (Optional) check the "Connect at startup" option so you automatically sync the moment the plugin loads.
* Let's...get...Storying! (DONE)

## Just starting
I started this whole project as a way for me to enjoy playing the game with my SO. It evolved from there so please bear with many features still missing. You can always request more. ðŸ˜Š

## Thanks
* Everyone contributing on the plugin-dev and dalamud-dev channels on the official [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) discord!
